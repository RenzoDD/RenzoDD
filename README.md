My name is Renzo Diaz and I am a senior college student. I am interested in software development and I like to create projects that help people become familiar around technology. Lately, I have been interested in blockchain and cryptography technologies and how they can be used to have a more equal society.

I am also a programming coach for freshman students and I believe that it is important that we all learn to code because it helps us to be more rational and to solve problems in our daily life. I just hope that one day I can help more people learn to program and create their own solutions to help their communities.
